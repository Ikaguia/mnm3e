Each additional rank increases your range one distance rank, so rank 2 is 120 feet, rank 3 is 250 feet, and so on. Remote Sensing overrides your normal sense(s) while you are using it. Subjects observed via Remote Sensing can &ldquo;feel&rdquo; it with an Insight check (DC 10 + rank).</p>\n<p>You can make Perception checks normally using your displaced senses, taking the normal action to do so. To search a large area for someone or something, use the search guidelines given in the description of the Investigation skill.</p>\n<p>Remote Sensing costs 1 point per rank for one sense type, 2 points per rank for two sense types, 3 points per rank for three, and 4 points per rank for four, and 5 points per rank for all of your senses. Visual senses count as two sense types (so visual Remote Sensing is 2 points per rank). You can use perception range sensory effects via Remote Sensing if your effect applies to their sense type and an accurate sense (usually sight). Sensory effects targeted on the spot where you have displaced your senses affect you normally.</p>\n<p>Because Remote Sensing overrides your normal senses, you are vulnerable (at half your normal active defenses) while using it, since you are less aware of your immediate surroundings.</p>\n<h1>EXTRAS</h1>\n<p><strong>Dimensional</strong>: This modifier allows you to extend your Remote Sensing into other dimensions with range proximate to your location in that dimension. One rank of Dimensional allows you to sense into a single other dimension, two for a group of related dimensions, and three for any dimension in the setting suitable to your Remote Sensing descriptors. Dimensional Remote Sensing for an accurate sense is especially useful for targeting other Dimension effects. <em>Flat +1 point per rank of Dimensional.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>No Conduit</strong></em>: Sensory effects targeted where you have displaced your senses do not affect you, but neither can you use perception ranged effects via your Remote Sensing. Despite the built-in limitation, this is an extra, since it allows you to use your Remote Sensing to observe subjects in relative safety. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Simultaneous</strong></em>: You can use both Remote Sensing and your normal senses at the same time, perceiving two locales like &ldquo;translucent&rdquo; overlays of each other. This means you&rsquo;re more capable of taking physical action while also using your Remote Sensing, although the effect still requires its normal duration to maintain. You are not vulnerable while using your Remote Sensing. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Subtle</strong>: Remote Sensing already has a degree of subtlety. Applying 1 rank of Subtle to Remote Sensing increases the DC to notice the effect to 20 + rank or makes it noticeable only to a particular unusual sense (with the usual DC 10 + rank perception check). Subtle 2 makes Remote Sensing completely unnoticeable, as usual. <em>Flat +1 point per rank of Subtle.</em></p>\n<h1>FLAWS</h1>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong>: With this flaw, damaging attacks directed at where you displaced your senses can affect you. Your sensory-point is considered to have partial cover from attacks and you use your Remote Sensing rank as your Toughness defense against any successful attack. The feedback may be psychosomatic in nature or due to some sort of disruption caused by an assault on the point where you have redirected your senses. Note that sensory effects already work on you via Remote Sensing and this flaw doesn&rsquo;t apply to them. <em>&ndash;1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Medium</strong>: You require a medium for your Remote Sensing, such as shadows, flames, mirrors, open water, television screens, and so forth. You can only perceive locations where your chosen medium exists. <em>&ndash;1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Noticeable</strong>: Remote Sensing with this flaw has an easily noticeable display, like a glowing set of eyes or a phantom image of your face, head, or body at the location you are observing. This manifestation cannot be used for communication, however (for that, take the Communication effect). <em>Flat &ndash;1 point.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sense-Dependent</strong>: Remote Sensing is already SenseDependent and cannot apply this flaw.

Your Leaping rank, minus 2, is the distance rank you cover in a single standing jump: so 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2, up to 1,000 miles at rank 20! You do not suffer any damage from landing after a jump, so long as it is within your maximum distance.</p>\n<p>The speed rank of your leap maxes out at 7 (around 250 miles per hour), so leaps of greater than distance rank 7 take time equal to the distance rank minus 7. For example, a massive leap of 500 miles (distance rank 17) takes time rank 10 (17 &ndash; 7, or two hours) of time in the air!

While this effect is active, you increase the affected trait by its rank. So, for example, Enhanced Strength 5 increases your Strength by +5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be below the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement to accommodate it. The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquiring a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait, and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and other effects. See <strong>Extra Effort</strong> in <strong>The Basics</strong> chapter and <strong>Enhanced Abilities</strong> in the <strong>Abilities</strong> chapter for more.</p>\n<h1>FLAWS</h1>\n<p><strong>Limited</strong>: Enhanced Traits are often Limited in some fashion, such as Nighttime (or Daytime) Only, While Angry (or in another emotional state), Underwater (or in some other environment), and so forth. A limit that rarely comes into play&mdash;like losing your Enhanced Trait during a new moon&mdash;can be handled as a power loss complication. See Complications in The Basics chapter for details. <em>&ndash;1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Permanent</strong>: At no change in cost, your Enhanced Trait may be a permanent improvement, rather than a sustained effect. The primary difference is that your permanent enhancement cannot be turned on and off and cannot be improved by extra effort, including using it to perform power stunts (see <strong>Extra Effort</strong>). There is no action to use a Permanent Enhanced Trait, as it is always active. <em>+0 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Reduced Trait</strong></em>: One or more of your traits is lowered while others are enhanced. This flaw is worth as many points as the reduction in the affected trait(s). So, for example, if you lose Intellect while you gain in Strength, treat the value of the lost Intellect ranks as the value of the flaw.

They may be made of solidified energy, &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; water or air, transmuted bulk matter, ice, stone, or some other medium, depending on the effect&rsquo;s descriptors.</p>\n<p>You can form any simple geometric shape or common object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk, etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular object is too complex for this effect. Generally, your objects can&rsquo;t have any moving parts more complex than a hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent, as you choose when you use the effect, limited by your descriptors and the Gamemaster&rsquo;s judgment.</p>\n<p>You can create an object with a maximum volume rank equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your effect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will by using your effect again (essentially &ldquo;re-creating&rdquo; the object). Your created objects are stationary once you have created them, although other effects can move them. Assume a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.</p>\n<h2>CREATED OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT</h2>\n<p>A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the object is opaque) just like a normal object. Cover provided by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks outgoing attacks as well. Attacks hitting the covering object damage it normally (see Damaging Objects, page 244). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a created object provides just like any other cover (see the <strong>Indirect</strong> modifier). The Selective modifier allows you to vary the cover and concealment your objects provide.</p>\n<h2>TRAPPING WITH OBJECTS</h2>\n<p>You can trap a target inside a large enough hollow object (a cage or bubble, for example). This requires both an attack check against the target&rsquo;s Dodge and a Dodge resistance check against the effect&rsquo;s rank. A trapped character can break out of the object normally. Imposing conditions on the target other than just trapping them requires a separate effect, such as Affliction (see <strong>Affliction</strong> in this chapter), which you may wish to acquire as an Alternate Effect of Create (see <strong>Alternate Effect</strong> in this chapter).</p>\n<h2>DROPPING OBJECTS</h2>\n<p>Simply dropping a created object on a target is treated like an Area Effect attack based on the object&rsquo;s size (see the <strong>Area</strong> extra in the <strong>Powers</strong> chapter). The object inflicts damage equal to its Toughness, and targets get a Dodge check to evade the falling object. A successful check results in no damage (rather than the usual half damage).</p>\n<p>While a created object can potentially be wielded as an improvised weapon, the effect cannot otherwise create attacks or other effects; you must acquire these effects separately (perhaps as Alternate Effects).</p>\n<h2>SUPPORTING WEIGHT</h2>\n<p>If a created object needs to support weight&mdash;created as a bridge or to support a weakened structure, for example&mdash;it has an effective Strength equal to its rank. You can &ldquo;shore up&rdquo; a created object by taking a standard action and concentrating, increasing its Strength by 1 until the start of your next round. You can also use extra effort to increase a created object&rsquo;s Strength for one round, and these modifiers are cumulative.</p>\n<h1>EXTRAS</h1>\n<p><strong>Continuous</strong>: Continuous Create makes objects that remain until they are destroyed, nullified, or you choose to dismiss them. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Impervious</strong>: Applied to Create, this extra makes the objects&rsquo; Toughness Impervious. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Innate</strong>: Continuous or Permanent Create with this modifier makes objects that cannot be nullified, they&rsquo;re essentially &ldquo;real&rdquo; objects for all intents and purposes (although the user can &ldquo;unmake&rdquo; them at will unless the effect is also permanent). <em>Flat +1 point.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Movable</strong>: You can move your created objects around with a Move Object effect at your Create rank (see Move Object in this chapter for details). <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Precise</strong>: You can create more precise and detailed objects. The exact parameters of Precise Create are up to the GM, but generally, you can create objects with moving parts, and considerable detail. <em>Flat +1 point.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Selective</strong>: You can make your created objects selectively &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; to attacks, blocking some while allowing others (yours and your allies&rsquo;, for example) to pass through them. You can also selectively make your objects solid to some creatures and incorporeal to others, such as allowing one person to walk through a created wall, while blocking another. It takes a free action to change the selective nature of an object; permanent created objects cannot have their selectivity changed once they are created. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stationary</strong>: Your created objects can hang immobile in the air. They resist being moved with a Strength rank equal to the modifier rank. Unless you have the Tether extra or the Movable extra, you cannot move a stationary created object once it&rsquo;s placed any more than anyone else can. +0 cost per rank. Subtle: This modifier either makes created objects not noticeable as constructs for 1 rank (they look just like real objects) or not noticeable at all for 2 ranks (such as objects composed of invisible force). <em>Flat +1or 2 points.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tether</strong>: You have a connection to your created objects, allowing you to exert your own Strength to move them (provided you are strong enough to do so). <em>Flat 1 point.</em></p>\n<h1>FLAWS</h1>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong>: You may suffer damage when your created objects are damaged (see the Feedback flaw description for details). <em>-1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Permanent</strong>: Permanent created objects last until destroyed or nullified. Unlike Continuous Create, you cannot choose to dismiss such objects; they are truly permanent. You cannot repair permanent created objects or otherwise alter them once they&rsquo;re created. <em>+0 cost per rank (for a Sustained effect).</em></p>\n<p><strong>Proportional</strong>: Your created objects have a total volume rank plus Toughness rank equal to your Create rank, rather than both volume and Toughness up to your rank. So you can create an object with volume rank 0 and Toughness equal to your Create rank, vice versa, or anywhere in between, so long as the sum of the two ranks does not exceed your Create rank. <em>&ndash;1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","rank":1,"baseCost":2,"extrasRankCost":0,"extrasFlatCost":0,"flawsRankCost":0,"flawsFlatCost":0,"overrideCost":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ivZkLTCCWgCEEUbG":3},"flags":{},"_id":"NWu2tCYuQh1lx8Ji"}

You can counter one effect of your chosen descriptor per use of Nullify. You can&rsquo;t nullify innate effects (see the <strong>Innate</strong> modifier description).</p>\n<p>Make a ranged attack check to hit the target. Then make an opposed check of your Nullify rank and the targeted effect&rsquo;s rank or the target&rsquo;s Will defense, whichever is higher. If you are targeting the subject of an effect rather than the effect&rsquo;s user, make an opposed check of Nullify rank vs. effect rank. If you win, the targeted effect turns off, although the user can re-activate it normally. If you lose the opposed check, you do not Nullify the effect. With two or more degrees of failure, trying again against the same subject in the same scene requires extra effort.</p>\n<h1>EXTRAS</h1>\n<p><strong>Affects Insubstantial</strong>: Nullify does not require this modifier to affect insubstantial targets, or the Insubstantial effect itself. You can attempt to nullify the effects of insubstantial targets normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternate Resistance</strong>: Nullify may require a Fortitude rather than a Will check to represent an effect resisted by health and stamina rather than strength of will. <em>+0 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Area</strong>: An Area Nullify effect works on all targets in the area. Make a single power check and compare the result against the opposed checks of the targets. Targets lacking effects you can nullify are, naturally, unaffected. If your Area Nullify has a duration longer than instant, choose whether or not the effect remains in the chosen area (affecting anyone entering or leaving it) or moves with the targets hit with the initial effect. There is no difference in cost, but to be able to do both, take one Area Nullify as an Alternate Effect of the other. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Broad</strong>: Broad Nullify can counter effects of a particularly broad descriptor like magical, mutant, or technological effects. This modifier is available only with the Gamemaster&rsquo;s permission and may depend on the effects available in the series. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Concentration</strong>: Any countered effect is suppressed and cannot be re-activated while you concentrate. The user of the countered effect may use extra effort to gain another opposed Nullify check.

For each rank in this effect, choose one of the following options:</p>\n<h2>DIMENSION TRAVEL</h2>\n<p>You can move instantly from one dimension to another as a move action. For 1 rank, you can move between your home dimension and one other. For 2 ranks you can move between any of a related group of dimensions (mystical dimensions, alien dimensions, etc). For 3 ranks you can travel to any dimension. You can carry up to 50 lbs. (mass rank 0) of additional material with you when you move. If you apply the Increased Mass modifier, you can carry additional mass up to your modifier rank.</p>\n<h2>ENVIRONMENTAL ADAPTATION</h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;re adapted to a particular environment, such as underwater, zero gravity, and so forth (see <strong>Environmental Hazards</strong>, pages 185-187, for details). You suffer none of the normal unfavorable circumstance or movement penalties associated with that environment, moving and acting normally. You are still affected by environmental hazards like suffocation, exposure, and so forth. You need the Immunity effect to ignore such things.</p>\n<h2>PERMEATE</h2>\n<p>You can pass through solid objects as if they weren&rsquo;t there. For 1 rank, you can move at speed rank &ndash;2 through any physical object. For 2 ranks, you can move at speed rank &ndash;1 and for 3 ranks, you move at your normal speed through any obstacles. You cannot breathe while completely inside a solid object, so you either need Immunity to Suffocation or have to hold your breath. You may also need Penetrates Concealment Senses to know where you&rsquo;re going, since you cannot see inside solid objects, either. Permeate is often Limited to a particular substance like earth, ice, or metal, for example. Permeate provides no protection against attacks, although you do gain cover while inside an object (see <strong>Cover</strong>, page 244). For the ability to allow things (including attacks) to pass through you, see the <strong>Insubstantial</strong> effect.</p>\n<h2>SAFE FALL</h2>\n<p>So long as you are capable of action, you can fall any distance without harm. You can also stop your fall at any point along a distance so long as there is a handhold or projection for you to grab (such as a ledge, flagpole, branch, etc.). If you have the Wall-crawling power (later in <strong>Movement</strong>), any surface you can climb provides you with a handhold. Safe Fall may be Limited to only when you are near a surface (such as the side of a building); you&rsquo;re assumed to be using the surface to help slow your fall.</p>\n<h2>SLITHERING</h2>\n<p>You can move while prone at your normal ground speed. You suffer no circumstance penalty for making attacks while prone. SPACE TRAVEL You can travel faster than the speed of light through the vacuum of space (but not in a planetary atmosphere). At rank 1 you can travel to other planets in a solar system. At rank 2, you can travel to other star systems, while at rank 3, you can visit distant star systems, perhaps even other galaxies! This effect does not provide protection from the rigors of outer space (for that, see the <strong>Immunity</strong> effect in this chapter).</p>\n<h2>SURE-FOOTED</h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;re better able to deal with obstacles and obstructions to movement. Reduce the speed penalty for moving through or around such obstacles by 1 for each rank of this effect. If you reduce the speed penalty to 0 or less, you are unaffected by that obstacle and move at full normal speed.</p>\n<h2>SWINGING</h2>\n<p>You can swing through the air at your normal ground speed rank, using a swing-line you provide or available lines and projections (tree limbs, flagpoles, vines, telephone- and power-lines, etc.).</p>\n<h2>TIME TRAVEL</h2>\n<p>You can move through time! For 1 rank, you can move between the present and another fixed point in time (such as 100 years into the past, or 1,000 years into the future). For 2 ranks you can move to any point in the past or any point in the future (but not both). For 3 ranks, you can travel to any point in time. Reaching alternate timelines or parallel worlds requires at least 2 ranks of Dimension-Travel. You can carry up to 50 lbs. (mass rank 0) of additional material with you when you time-travel. If you apply the Increased Mass modifier, you can carry additional mass up to your modifier rank.</p>\n<h2>TRACKLESS</h2>\n<p>You leave no trail and cannot be tracked using visual senses (although you can still be tracked using scent or other means). You can walk across the surface of soft sand or snow without leaving tracks and you have total concealment from tremorsense (see <strong>Concealment</strong>, page 244). Each additional rank renders you trackless to another sense type.</p>\n<h2>WALL-CRAWLING</h2>\n<p>You can climb walls and ceilings at your ground speed rank &ndash;1 with no chance of falling and no need for an Athletics check. You are still vulnerable while climbing, however. An additional rank of this effect means you climb at your full speed rank and are not vulnerable while climbing.</p>\n<h2>WATER-WALKING</h2>\n<p>You can stand or move at your normal ground speed on the surface of water, quicksand, and other liquids without sinking. If you fall prone for any reason, you sink into the liquid normally. With 2 ranks of this effect, you can also lie prone on a liquid surface without sinking; you only sink if you choose to.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","rank":1,"baseCost":2,"extrasRankCost":0,"extrasFlatCost":0,"flawsRankCost":0,"flawsFlatCost":0,"overrideCost":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ivZkLTCCWgCEEUbG":3},"flags":{},"_id":"YQnJI02Q3cXtjM29"}

{"name":"Damage","type":"power","img":"icons/svg/explosion.svg","data":{"description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Damage</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action</strong>: Standard</li>\n<li><strong>Range</strong>: Close</li>\n<li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instant</li>\n<li><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 point per rank</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>You can inflict damage on a target by making a close attack. The exact nature of your Damage is up to you, with the GM&rsquo;s approval; it can be anything from a powerful impact to razor claws, energy fields, or some other damaging medium. The target resists with Toughness:</p>\n<h2>DAMAGE RESISTANCE CHECK</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Toughness vs. [Damage rank + 15]</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Success</strong>: The damage has no effect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Failure (one degree):</strong> The target has a &ndash;1 circumstance penalty to further resistance checks against damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Failure (two degrees)</strong>: The target is dazed until the end of their next turn and has a &ndash;1 circumstance penalty to further checks against damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Failure (three degrees)</strong>: The target is staggered and has a -1 circumstance penalty to further checks against damage. If the target is staggered again (three degrees of failure on a Damage resistance check), apply the fourth degree of effect. The staggered condition remains until the target recovers (see Recovery, following).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Failure (four degrees)</strong>: The target is incapacitated .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The circumstance penalties to Toughness checks are cumulative, so a target who fails three resistance checks against Damage, each with one degree of failure, has a total &ndash;3 penalty. If an incapacitated target fails a resistance check against Damage, the target&rsquo;s condition shifts to dying. A dying target who fails a resistance check against Damage is dead.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">STRENGTH AND DAMAGE</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Strength provides a &ldquo;built-in&rdquo; Damage effect: the ability to hit things! You can apply effect modifiers to the Damage your Strength inflicts, making it Penetrating or even an Area effect! You can also have Alternate Effects for your Strength Damage; see the <strong>Alternate Effect</strong> modifier for details. Like other Damage effects, a character&rsquo;s Strength Damage is close range and instant duration by default.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you choose, a Damage effect can be Strength based&mdash;something like a melee weapon&mdash;allowing your Strength Damage to add to it. You add your Strength and Damage ranks together when determining the rank of the attack. Any modifiers applied to your Damage must also apply to your Strength rank if its bonus damage is to benefit from them. However, any decrease in your Strength reduces the amount you can add to your Damage, and negative Strength subtracts from your Damage! Likewise, anything that prevents you from exerting your Strength also stops you from using a Strength-based Damage effect. If you can&rsquo;t swing your fist, you can&rsquo;t swing a sword, either. On the other hand, a laser blade or thuderbolt staff does the same damage whether you can exert your Strength with it or not.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">DAMAGING OBJECTS</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Objects (targets lacking a Stamina rank) take damage similar to other targets. Dazed and staggered results have no real effect on inanimate targets, since they do not take actions. Constructs, capable of action, are dazed and staggered normally (see <strong>Constructs</strong> in the <strong>Gadgets &amp; Gear</strong> chapter).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and therefore subject to finishing attacks (see <strong>Finishing Attack</strong> in the <strong>Action &amp; Adventure</strong> chapter): essentially, you can choose between making your attack on the object as a routine check or, if you make the attack check normally, gaining an automatic critical hit if your attack hits, for a +5 bonus to effect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a smash action (see <strong>Smash</strong> in the <strong>Actions</strong> section of <strong>Chapter 8</strong> for more details). If an attacker&rsquo;s intention is to bend, break or destroy an object, then two degrees of failure on the Toughness check results in a bend or break (such as a hole punched through the object) while three or more degrees of failure means the object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Example</strong>: Lady Liberty, rescuing people from a tenement fire, is hemmed-in by collapsed debris. Her player decides to simply punch a path through. Since she&rsquo;s going for maximum damage, she decides to make the attack check normally (rather than a routine check). Given her attack bonus, she&rsquo;ll only miss on a natural 1 anyway. She succeeds and does her Strength in Damage, +5 for the automatic critical. The GM decides the brick, mortar, and heavy beams have a toughness of 9 and makes a Toughness check, rolling a 5, against a DC 30 (Lady Liberty&rsquo;s Damage +15). A 14 result is three degrees of failure, so she easily smashes through the debris and clears the building, carrying people to safety!</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Toughness ranks of some common materials are shown on the <strong>Material Toughness</strong> table. The listed ranks are for about an inch (distance rank &ndash;7) thickness of the material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a &ndash;1 per halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Material Toughness</h3>\n<table style=\"height: 160px; width: 37.3761%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Material</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Toughness</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Paper</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Soil</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Glass</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Ice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Rope</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Wood</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Stone</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Iron</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Reinforced Concrete</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Steel</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Titanium</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">Super-Alloys</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.6477%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">20+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">RECOVERY</h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Living targets remove one damage condition per minute of rest, starting from their worst condition and working back.

You must touch the target, making a normal close attack check.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">WEAKEN RESISTANCE CHECK</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Fortitude or Will vs. DC [10 + Weaken rank]</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Success</strong>: No effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong>: The target loses power points from the affected trait equal to the difference between the check result and the DC, up to a maximum of the Weaken rank.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Multiple failed resistance checks against a Weaken effect are cumulative, up to a maximum of the Weaken rank, at which point the effect cannot weaken the trait further. Lost points return at a rate of 1 per round at the end of each of the target&rsquo;s turns. Inanimate objects do not recover weakened Toughness; they must be repaired. Objects may or may not recover other weakened traits, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion and depending on the effect&rsquo;s descriptors.</p>\n<h1>WEAKENING ABILITIES</h1>\n<p>Abilities weakened <em>below</em> a rank of &ndash;5 become debilitated. See <strong>Debilitated Abilities</strong> for details of specific abilities at this point. It is not possible to weaken an ability past the point of debilitation. Any further uses of Weaken on the subject have no effect until the ability recovers to a rank of at least &ndash;5.</p>\n<h1>WEAKENING DEVICES</h1>\n<p>Weaken with Affects Objects and the right descriptor(s) can lower the traits provided by a device (see the <strong>Removable</strong> flaw in this chapter and the <strong>Gadgets &amp; Gear</strong> chapter). For example, Weaken Magic could potentially drain the powers of a magical device as well as a target&rsquo;s own magical powers. Likewise Weaken Electricity could affect an electrical device, and so on. This also applies to equipment, although it tends to have fewer traits to weaken, and the GM should feel free to disallow any Weaken effects that don&rsquo;t make reasonable sense. For example, just because a Weaken Damage effect is possible doesn&rsquo;t mean a character should be able to cause guns to do less damage; this sort of thing is better handled by an all-or-nothing effect like Nullify (see its description earlier in this chapter).</p>\n<h1>EXTRAS</h1>\n<p><strong>Affects Objects</strong>: Weaken with this modifier works on inanimate objects, although the effect can still only affect traits the objects possess. This is most often applied to Weaken Toughness for an effect that can weaken both creatures and objects. <em>+1 cost per rank, +0 for Affects Only Objects.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Broad</strong>: You can Weaken any of a broad set of traits, one at a time suited to your effects descriptors. So you might be able to Weaken Abilities, for example, or Weaken Mental Effects. You choose which trait from the set is weakened when you use the effect. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Concentration</strong>: Once you have hit with a Concentration Weaken, so long as you continue to take a standard action each turn to maintain the effect, the target must make a new resistance check against it, with no attack check required. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Incurable</strong>: Weaken with this modifier cannot have its effects countered by another power (such as Restorative Healing) without the Persistent modifier; the target must recover from the Weaken normally. <em>Flat +1 point.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Precise</strong>: A Weaken effect capable of reducing more than one trait at once can have this modifier, allowing you to choose which traits are affected, while not affecting others. Note this differs from the Selective extra (following). <em>Flat +1 point.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Progressive</strong>: A Progressive Weaken effect reduces the affected traits each round until the target successfully resists. Make a new resistance check for the target at the end of each turn; failure weakens the affected trait(s) further, while success stops the Progressive Weaken, but the target must still recover ranks already lost (at the rate of 1 point per turn). <em>+2 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Selective</strong>: This extra is applied to an Area Weaken so it only affects some targets and not others. Combined with Precise (previously), you can use an Area Weaken to selectively affect only certain traits of certain targets. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Simultaneous</strong>: If applied to a Broad Weaken, this extra allows it to affect all of the traits in its set at the same time. Each trait loses the difference between the resistance check result and the DC in power points on a failed check. So a Simultaneous Weaken Fire Effects subtracts points from every fire effect the target possesses with a single attack. The effect must be Broad to apply this modifier. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","rank":1,"baseCost":1,"extrasRankCost":0,"extrasFlatCost":0,"flawsRankCost":0,"flawsFlatCost":0,"overrideCost":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ivZkLTCCWgCEEUbG":3},"flags":{},"_id":"fpAb4Od6XqJQw2ET"}

By taking a move action to concentrate you can increase this by +1 Str, changing the effect&rsquo;s duration to Concentration (see <strong>Duration</strong> at the start of this chapter). This is in addition to using extra effort to further increase your rank (see <strong>Extra Effort</strong>, page 19).</p>\n<p>This effect can move objects, but cannot perform tasks of fine manipulation (like untying knots, typing, or manipulating controls) without the Precise modifier.

You can use it to make disarm, grab, and trip attacks. See the Action &amp; Adventure chapter for details.</p>\n<h1>EXTRAS</h1>\n<p><strong>Continuous</strong>: Move Move Object generally cannot have a continuous duration, since it is an active effect and requires at least a modicum of attention to maintain. The GM may allow Continuous Move Object as a variation that is not disrupted when you are unable to maintain it, but that still requires your conscious attention to do anything other than have the affected object hang in midair. There&rsquo;s no change in the cost of the extra, this is just a limitation of the Move Object effect <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Damaging</strong>: Your effect can inflict damage, like an application of normal Strength with damage equal to its rank. This includes damaging targets in grabs and making ranged &ldquo;strike&rdquo; attacks. +1 cost per rank.</p>\n<p><strong> Improvised Weapon or Throwing Mastery</strong>: You are particularly adept at using objects as weapons with your power.

Apply the Subtle modifier for a less noticeable Move Object effect, such as invisible &ldquo;psychokinesis&rdquo; (which is generally also Perception Range). <em>+1 point per rank.</em></p>\n<h1>FLAWS</h1>\n<p><strong>Close</strong>: Since Move Object works on things at a distance by definition, it cannot generally be reduced to close ranged. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, a Close Ranged Move Object effect may represent &ldquo;tactile telekinesis&rdquo; or a supernatural influence over objects you are able to touch, but such things are usually better represented by the Enhanced Strength effect. <em>&ndash;1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","rank":1,"baseCost":2,"extrasRankCost":0,"extrasFlatCost":0,"flawsRankCost":0,"flawsFlatCost":0,"overrideCost":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ivZkLTCCWgCEEUbG":3},"flags":{},"_id":"kIbITgEsCeCxMlZU"}
{"name":"Senses","type":"power","img":"icons/svg/blind.svg","data":{"description":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Senses</h1>\n<p><strong>Action</strong>: None</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong>: Personal</p>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent</p>\n<p><strong>Cost</strong>: 1 point per rank</p>\n<hr />\n<p>One or more of your senses are improved, or you have additional sensory abilities beyond the normal five senses. Allocate ranks in Senses to the following effects. Some options require more than one rank, noted in their descriptions. So if you have Senses 5, for example, you can have darkvision (2 ranks), direction sense (1 rank), distance sense (1 rank), and ultra-hearing (1 rank), or any other combination adding up to 5 ranks.</p>\n<p>Like all sensory effects, Senses uses the sense types described on page 178 as descriptors.</p>\n<h2>ACCURATE 2 OR 4 RANKS</h2>\n<p>An accurate sense can pinpoint something&rsquo;s exact location. You can use an accurate sense to target something in combat. Visual and tactile senses are normally accurate for humans. Cost is 2 ranks for one sense, 4 for an entire sense type.</p>\n<h2>ACUTE 1-2 RANKS</h2>\n<p>You can sense fine details about anything you can detect with a particular sense, allowing you to distinguish between and identify different subjects. Visual and auditory senses are normally acute for humans. Cost is 1 rank for one sense, 2 for an entire sense type.</p>\n<h2>ANALYTICAL 1-2 RANKS</h2>\n<p>Beyond even acute, you can perceive specific details about anything you can detect with an analytical sense, such as chemical composition, exact dimensions or mass, frequency of sounds and energy wavelengths, and so forth. You can only apply this effect to an acute sense. Normal senses are not analytical. Cost is 1 rank for one sense, 2 for an entire sense type.</p>\n<h2>AWARENESS 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can sense the use of effects of a particular descriptor with a successful Perception check (DC 10, with &ndash;1 to your check per 10 feet range). Examples include Cosmic Awareness, Divine Awareness, Magical Awareness, Mental Awareness, and so forth. You can apply other Sense effects to your Awareness to modify it. Choose the sense type for your Awareness; it is often a mental sense, but doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Awareness counts as an &ldquo;exotic sense&rdquo; for noticing effects with the first rank of the Subtle modifier (see <strong>Subtle</strong> under <strong>Extras</strong> for details).</p>\n<h2>COMMUNICATION LINK 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You have a link with a particular individual, chosen when you acquire this option, who must also have this ability. The two of you can communicate over any distance like a use of the Communication effect. Choose a sense type as a communication medium when you select this option; mental is common for psychic or empathic links. If you apply the Dimensional modifier to your Communication Link, it extends to other dimensions as well (see <strong>Dimensional</strong> under <strong>Power Modifiers</strong> for details).</p>\n<h2>COUNTERS CONCEALMENT 2 RANKS</h2>\n<p>A sense type with this trait ignores the Concealment effect of a particular descriptor; you sense the subject of the effect normally, as if the Concealment wasn&rsquo;t even there. So if you have vision that Counters Invisibility, for example, then invisible beings are visible to you. For 5 ranks, the sense type ignores <em>all</em> Concealment effects, regardless of descriptor. Concealed subjects seem slightly &ldquo;off&rdquo; to you, enough to know they are concealed to others. This trait does not affect concealment provided by opaque objects, for that, see Penetrates Concealment.</p>\n<h2>COUNTERS ILLUSION 2 RANKS</h2>\n<p>A sense type with this trait ignores the Illusion effect; you automatically succeed on your resistance check against the illusion if it affects your sense type, realizing that it isn&rsquo;t real.</p>\n<h2>DANGER SENSE 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>When you would normally be surprised in combat, make a Perception check (DC 10): One degree of success means you&rsquo;re not surprised, but can&rsquo;t act during the surprise round (so you don&rsquo;t suffer any conditions of being surprised), while two or more degrees of success means you are not surprised and may act during the surprise round (if any). Failure means you are surprised (although, if you have Uncanny Dodge, you are not vulnerable). The GM may raise the DC of the Danger Sense check in some circumstances. Choose a sense type for your Danger Sense. Sensory effects targeting that sense also affect your Danger Sense ability and may &ldquo;blind&rdquo; it.</p>\n<h2>DARKVISION 2 RANKS</h2>\n<p>You can see in complete darkness as if it were normal daylight; darkness provides no concealment to your vision. This is essentially the same as Counters Concealment (Darkness).</p>\n<h2>DETECT 1-2 RANKS</h2>\n<p>You can sense a particular item or effect by touch with a Perception check. Detect has no range and only indicates the presence or absence of something (being neither acute nor accurate). Choose what sense type your Detect falls under (often mental). For 2 ranks you can detect things at range (with the normal &ndash;1 per 10 feet modifier to your Perception check).</p>\n<h2>DIRECTION SENSE 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You always know what direction north lies in and can retrace your steps through any place you&rsquo;ve been.</p>\n<h2>DISTANCE SENSE 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can accurately and automatically judge distances.</p>\n<h2>EXTENDED 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You have a sense that operates at greater than normal range. Your range with the sense&mdash;the distance used to determine penalties to your Perception check&mdash;is increased by a factor of 10. Each additional time you apply this option, your range increases by an additional factor of 10, so 1 rank means you have a &ndash;1 to Perception checks per 100 feet, 2 ranks makes it &ndash;1 per 1,000 feet, and so on. An extended sense may be limited by conditions like the horizon and physical barriers between you and the subject, unless it also Penetrates Concealment.</p>\n<h2>INFRAVISION 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can see in the infrared portion of the spectrum, allowing you to see heat patterns. Darkness does not provide concealment for objects differing in temperature from their surroundings. If you have the Track effect, you can track warm creatures by the faint heat trails they leave behind. The Gamemaster is the final judge on how long the trail remains visible.</p>\n<h2>LOW-LIGHT VISION 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You ignore circumstance penalties to visual Perception checks for poor lighting, so long as it is not completely dark.</p>\n<h2>MICROSCOPIC VISION 1-4 RANKS</h2>\n<p>You can view extremely small things. You can make Perception checks to see tiny things nearby. Cost is 1 rank for dust-sized objects, 2 ranks for cellular-sized, 3 ranks for DNA and complex molecules, 4 ranks for atomic-sized. The GM may require an Expertise skill check to understand and interpret what you see.</p>\n<h2>PENETRATES CONCEALMENT 4 RANKS</h2>\n<p>A sense with this trait is unaffected by concealment from obstacles (rather than Concealment effects). So vision that Penetrates Concealment sees right through opaque objects, for example, and hearing that Penetrates Concealment is unaffected by sound-proofing or intervening materials, and so forth.</p>\n<h2>POSTCOGNITION 4 RANKS</h2>\n<p>Your senses extend into the past, allowing you to perceive events that took place previously. You can make Perception checks to pick up on past information in an area or from a subject. The Gamemaster sets the DC for these checks based on how obscure and distant in the past the information is, from DC 15 (for a vague vision that may or may not be accurate) to DC 30 (for near complete knowledge of a particular past event as if you were actually present). Your normal (present-day) senses don&rsquo;t work while you&rsquo;re using Postcognition; your awareness is focused on the past. Your postcognitive visions last for as long as you concentrate. Postcognition does not apply to sensory effects like Mind Reading or any other ability requiring interaction. Postcognition may be Limited to past events connected to your own &ldquo;past lives&rdquo; or ancestors, reducing cost to 2 ranks.</p>\n<h2>PRECOGNITION 4 RANKS</h2>\n<p>Your senses extend into the future, allowing you to perceive events that may happen. Your precognitive visions represent possible futures. If circumstances change, then the vision may not come to pass. When you use this ability, the Gamemaster chooses what information to impart. Your visions may be obscure and cryptic, open to interpretation. The Gamemaster may require appropriate Perception skill checks for you to pick up on particularly detailed information, with a DC ranging from 15 to 30 or more. The GM can also activate your Precognition to impart specific information to you as an adventure hook or plot device. Your normal (present-day) senses don&rsquo;t work while you&rsquo;re using Precognition; your awareness is focused on the future. Your precognitive visions last as long as you concentrate. Precognition does not apply to sensory effects like Mind Reading or any other ability requiring interaction.</p>\n<h2>RADIO 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can &ldquo;hear&rdquo; radio frequencies including AM, FM, television, cellular, police bands, and so forth. This allows you to pick up on Radio Communication (see the Communication effect). This is the base sense of the radio sense type. It&rsquo;s ranged, radius, and acute by default.</p>\n<h2>RADIUS 1-2 RANKS</h2>\n<p>You can make Perception checks with a radius sense for any point around you. Subjects behind you cannot use Stealth to hide from you without some other concealment. Auditory, olfactory, and tactile senses are normally radius for humans. Cost is 1 rank for use with one sense, 2 ranks for one sense type.</p>\n<h2>RANGED 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can use a sense that normally has no range (taste or touch in humans) to make Perception checks at range, with the normal &ndash;1 per 10 feet modifier. This can be enhanced with the Extended Sense effect.</p>\n<h2>RAPID 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can read or take in information from a sense faster than normal: each rank increases your perception speed by a factor of 10 (x10, x100, etc.) with a single sense, double cost for an entire sense type. You can use rapid vision to speedread, pick up on rapid flickering between frames of a film, watch video replays in fast-forward speeds, and such, rapid hearing to listen to time-compressed audio &ldquo;blips,&rdquo; and so forth.</p>\n<h2>TIME SENSE 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You always know what time it is and can time events as if you had an accurate stopwatch.</p>\n<h2>TRACKING 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can follow trails and track using a particular sense. Basic DC to follow a trail is 10, modified by circumstances, as the GM sees fit. You move at your speed rank &ndash;1 while tracking. For 2 ranks, you can move at full normal speed while tracking.</p>\n<h2>ULTRA-HEARING 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can hear very high and low frequency sounds, like dog whistles or ultrasonic signals, including those used by some remote controls.</p>\n<h2>ULTRAVISION 1 RANK</h2>\n<p>You can see ultraviolet light, allowing you to see normally at night by the light of the stars or other UV light sources.</p>\n<h1>EXTRAS</h1>\n<p><strong>Affects Others</strong>: You can grant the benefits of one or more Senses to another character. Apply Affects Others only to the ranks of the chosen sense(s). <em>+0 or +1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Area</strong>: The Area modifier only applies to Senses that Affect Others, and only to extend their benefits to everyone in an area. Apply the Selective modifier for the ability to choose who in the area does and does not benefit from the Senses. To affect the area of a sense itself, use the Extended and Radius traits of the Senses effect. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimensional</strong>: This modifier allows you to extend your senses into other dimensions. It&rsquo;s assumed to apply to all your senses, allowing you to sense your proximate location in the other dimension(s). For a more extended range, use Remote Sensing with this modifier. <em>+1 point per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Innate</strong>: Senses, particularly those of aliens or constructs like robots, may be Innate, although this does not prevent sensory effects like Concealment or Dazzle from disabling them. <em>Flat +1 point.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ranged</strong>: Likewise, the Ranged extra only applies to Senses that Affect Others, extending the distance at which you can grant their benefits. To extend the range of a sense itself, use the Extended, Radius, and Ranged options of the Senses effect. <em>+1 or +2 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<h1>FLAWS</h1>\n<p><strong>Limited</strong>: Some Senses may be Limited to only sensing certain things or only under certain circumstances. As usual, the sense must lose about half its utility to qualify for this flaw, less than that is more likely a particular descriptor associated with the sense and may constitute a complication at the GM&rsquo;s discretion when it comes up in play. <em>&ndash;1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Noticeable</strong>: Senses with this flaw are particularly noticeable in some way: your eyes may glow, for example, or you may emit a noticeable sound, vibration, energy, or the like for use as a sensor. <em>Flat &ndash;1 point. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Unreliable</strong>: Some Senses may be unreliable; the GM makes checks for reliability when the sense is used. Two variations of this flaw may apply: in the first, the Senses effect is unreliable, when it doesn&rsquo;t work, the character perceives nothing with that sense. In the second, the character&rsquo;s perceptions are unreliable, the sense appears to work, but the character gets the wrong information. For this reason, the GM should make all reliability checks for Senses in secret, just informing the player of what the character does (or does not) notice. <em>&ndash;1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","rank":1,"baseCost":1,"extrasRankCost":0,"extrasFlatCost":0,"flawsRankCost":0,"flawsFlatCost":0,"overrideCost":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ivZkLTCCWgCEEUbG":3},"flags":{},"_id":"luPMfRDFilzxw2j9"}

Each additional rank gives you concealment from another sense; two ranks give you concealment for an entire sense type. See <strong>Concealment</strong> on page 244 for the full effects.</p>\n<p>Concealment from visual senses costs double (2 ranks for one visual sense, 4 ranks for all visual senses). You cannot have concealment from tactile senses, since that requires being incorporeal (see the <strong>Insubstantial</strong> effect). So with Concealment 5, you can have total concealment from all visual senses (4 ranks) and normal hearing (1 rank), for example. With Concealment 10 you have total concealment from <em>all</em> sense types other than tactile.</p>\n<h1>EXTRAS</h1>\n<p><strong>Affects Others</strong>: This modifier allows you to grant Concealment to others while you are touching them, or at range, if you also apply the Range modifier. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Area</strong>: Concealment with Affects Others (previously) or Attack (immediately following) may have this extra, affecting everything in the area. To only affect some targets in the area, apply the Selective modifier as well. <em>+1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Attack</strong>: Use this extra for a Concealment effect you can impose on others (whether they want to be concealed or not). An invisibility ray, for example, is a Visual Concealment Attack, while a field of darkness is a Burst Area Visual Concealment Attack. <em>+0 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Precise</strong>: You can vary your Concealment at will as a free action: going from total to partial to no concealment, concealing some parts and not others, or anywhere inbetween.

One example is Limited to Machines, where your Concealment only fools senses with a technological descriptor. <em>-1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Partial</strong>: Your effect provides partial rather than total concealment (see Concealment, page 244, for details). <em>-1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong> Passive</strong>: Your Concealment only lasts until you do something requiring an attack or effect check on your part, at which point it stops working until you reactivate it, which you may do on the following round. <em>-1 cost per rank.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Resistible</strong>: Your Concealment offers a resistance check (chose a defense when the flaw is applied) for anyone aware of your presence and actively looking for you.
