	"MNM3E.actionAidDesc": "If you are in position to attack an opponent, you can attempt to aid an ally engaged in melee with that opponent as a standard action. This is like a team check (see <b>Team Checks</b> in <b>The Basics</b> chapter): You make an attack check against DC 10. If you succeed, you don’t actually hit or affect the opponent, but success grants your ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus on an attack check against that opponent or a +2 circumstance bonus to Defense against that opponent (your choice) until the end of your ally’s next turn. Three or more degrees of success grant a +5 bonus.",
	"MNM3E.actionAimDesc": "By taking a standard action to aim and line up an attack, you get a bonus to hit when you make the attack. If you’re making a close attack, or a ranged attack at close range, you get a +5 circumstance bonus on your attack check. If you’re making a ranged attack from a greater distance, you get a +2 circumstance bonus.\nHowever, you are vulnerable while aiming and it requires a free action to maintain your aim before you make your attack. If you are unable to maintain it, you lose its benefit.\nOnce you aim, your next action must be to make the attack. Taking a different action spoils your aim and you lose the bonus.",
	"MNM3E.actionAttackDesc": "With a standard action, you can make an attack check against any opponent within the attack’s range. If the attack is an area effect or perception range, no attack check is needed. It affects the area or target automatically.",
	"MNM3E.actionChargeDesc": "You rush forward to attack. You move your speed rank in a mode of movement available to you in a relatively straight line towards your target. At the end of your movement, you perform a close attack against your opponent with a –2 circumstance penalty to the attack check.\nYou can combine a charge action with a move action, allowing you to move up to twice your speed (your speed rank as a move action, then your speed rank again when you charge).",
	"MNM3E.actionCommandDesc": "Issuing a command to a character under your control—a minion or a thrall—requires a move action. If you want to issue different commands to different characters or groups, each one requires a move action (so you can issue two commands per round as two move actions)",
	"MNM3E.actionCrawlDesc": "While prone, you can only move by crawling. You crawl at your normal ground speed –1 rank (or half your normal speed).\nCharacters with the Slither effect of Movement crawl at their normal ground speed. See <b>Movement</b> in the <b>Powers</b> chapter for details",
	"MNM3E.actionDefendDesc": "Rather than attacking, you focus on defense. Make an opposed check of your appropriate active defense versus any attack made on you until the start of your next turn. Add 10 to any roll of 10 or less that you make on these checks, just as if you spent a hero point (thus ensuring a minimum roll of 11). The attacker must equal or exceed your opposed check result in order to hit you.",
	"MNM3E.actionDelayDesc": "When you delay, you choose to take your turn later in the initiative order. You must delay your entire turn. You cannot delay if you have already taken an action on your turn, or if you are unable to take actions.\nAt any point after any other character in the conflict has acted, you can choose to take your turn. Your initiative moves into the new place in the order where you act, and you take your normal allocation of actions. If you do not act before your initiative comes up in the next round, your turn ends, you lose your delayed turn, and your initiative remains where it is.\nBeneficial effects lasting until the end of your turn end when you choose to delay, but harmful effects that last until the end of your turn last until after you act. Likewise, you do not make resistance checks until after you have taken your turn, so delaying can draw out some effects.",
	"MNM3E.actionDisarmDesc": "You attempt to knock an item—such as a weapon or device—out of an opponent’s grasp. Make an attack check against the defender with a –2 penalty. If you attempt to disarm with a ranged attack, you are at –5 penalty. If your attack succeeds, make an opposed check of your attack’s damage against the defender’s Strength. If you win, the defender dropped the held object. If you made the disarm unarmed, you can grab the dropped object as a free action. If you make a disarm attempt with a melee weapon and lose the opposed check, the defender may immediately make an attempt to disarm you as a reaction; make another opposed damage vs. Strength check. If this disarm attempt fails, you do not, however, get an additional attempt to disarm the defender.",
	"MNM3E.actionDropItemDesc": "Dropping a held item is a free action (although dropping or throwing an item with the intention of hitting something with it is a standard attack action).",
	"MNM3E.actionDropProneDesc": "Dropping to a prone position is a free action, although getting up requires a move action (see <b>Stand</b>).",
	"MNM3E.actionEscapeDesc": "You attempt to escape from a successful grab (see <b>Grab</b>). Make a check of your Athletics or Acrobatics against the routine check result of your opponent’s Strength or grab effect rank. If you succeed, you end the grab and can move away from your opponent, up to your normal ground speed minus one rank, if you choose. If you fail, you are still grabbed.",
	"MNM3E.actionGrabDesc": "You attempt to grab a target. Make an attack check against the target. If successful, the target makes a resistance check against your Strength (or the rank of a grabbing effect) using the better of Strength or Dodge. If you win with one degree of success, the target is restrained (immobile and vulnerable). Two or more degrees leave your opponent bound (defenseless, immobile, and impaired). You can attempt to improve an existing hold with another grab action on a following turn. Any resulting degrees of success are cumulative, but if you lose, the target escapes.\nYou are hindered and vulnerable while grabbing and holding an opponent. You can maintain a successful grab as a free action each turn, but cannot perform other actions requiring the use of your grabbing limb(s) while doing so. Since maintaining a grab is a free action, you can take a standard action to inflict your Strength damage to a grabbed target on subsequent turns after the grab is established.\nYou can drag a restrained or bound target along with you when you move. The target gets a Strength resistance check against your Strength. If it fails, you move and the target moves along with you. If the target resists, you are immobilized that turn unless you release your hold on the target.\nYou can end a grab (releasing your target) as a free action. If you are unable to take the free action maintain the hold, the target is automatically released. A target can attempt to escape from a grab as a move action (see <b>Escape</b>).",
	"MNM3E.actionMoveDesc": "You can move up to your normal speed rank in any movement mode available to you as a move action. Normally this is rank 0 ground speed for most people (up to 30 feet). If you choose to move twice on your turn (taking two move actions) then you move your speed rank each time. You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to run faster: one or more degree of success increases your ground speed rank by +1 for one round.",
	"MNM3E.actionReadyDesc": "Readying lets you prepare to take an action later, after you would normally act on your initiative, but before your initiative on your next turn. Readying is a standard action, so you can move as well.\nYou can ready a single standard, move, or free action. To do so, specify the action you will take and the circumstances under which you will take it. Then, any time before your next turn, you may take the readied action as a reaction to those circumstances. Your place in the initiative order then becomes the point where you took your readied action.\nIf you come to your next turn and have not yet performed your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied action, you just lose your previous turn. You can ready the same action again on your next turn, if you wish, continuing to wait for the right circumstances.",
	"MNM3E.actionRecoverDesc": "You take your entire turn to try and catch your breath and bounce back a bit. When you recover, you can remove your highest level of damage or fatigue. Alternately, rather than removing a level of damage or fatigue, you can choose to make a resistance check against an ongoing effect, in addition to the normal resistance check at the end of your turn.\nYou can only recover once per conflict. Once you have done so, you must recover from any remaining damage, fatigue, or effects normally (or with outside assistance).\nWhen you recover, you gain +2 to your active defenses until the start of your next turn.",
	"MNM3E.actionSmashDesc": "You attempt to damage or break an object held or worn by an opponent. Make an attack check against the defense of the character with the object, with a –5 circumstance penalty if you are attacking a held object. If your attack check succeeds, you inflict damage on the object rather than the character. See <b>Damaging Objects</b> for details on breaking things.",
	"MNM3E.actionStandDesc": "You stand up from a prone position. You can go from prone to standing as a free action by making a DC 20 Acrobatics check. Characters with the Instant Up advantage can stand as a free action without a skill check",
	"MNM3E.actionTripDesc": "You try to trip or throw your opponent to the ground. Make a close attack check against your opponent’s Parry with a –2 circumstance penalty on the check. If the attack succeeds, make an opposed check of your Acrobatics or Athletics against your opponent’s Acrobatics or Athletics. Use whichever has the better bonus in each case.\nIf you win, the defender is prone in an area adjacent to you of your choice. If you lose, the defender immediately gets another opposed check to try and trip you. If it fails, the trip attempt ends.",
